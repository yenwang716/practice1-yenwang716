I am a computer science major with a minor of data science. \
I have a minor in data science too! \
I've beening studying context free grammar in COMS 342, creating a map for COMS 327, and studying about operating system in COMS 352.\
This sounds like inportant information. It also sounds difficult. \
The most important tools or strategies I use to organize my work is using folders to organize files/documents and keep them clean and neat.\
Yeah I have been working on this. I'm getting better though!
